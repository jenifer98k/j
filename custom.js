
// JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.




// javascript is scripted language => light weight runs in web browser
// lightweight => can run on almost any device without requiring a lot of memory or processing power
// js => cross-platform=> Cross-platform is the ability of software applications to operate on multiple operating systems (OS) or hardware platforms with little or no modification.
// A single-threaded language is one that can execute only one task at a time.

// => Client-side: dom manipulation 
// => Server-side: communicate with a database,



// # Synchronous and Single-Threaded

   // Single-Threaded: JavaScript executes one command at a time, meaning it can only do one thing at a moment.

// - Synchronous: Each line of code is executed in sequence. The next line of code is executed only after the current one has finished.






// external js

document.write("<h1>hello world1232</h2>");
alert("sivaranjani");
console.log('hllo from console ')











// Variables are Containers for Storing Data
// JavaScript Variables can be declared in 3 ways:


// Using var
// Using let
// Using const

var a = 1;

let b = 7;
const c = 8;


// The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

// The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

// The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.


// When to Use var, let, or const?
// 1. Always declare variables

// 2. Always use const if the value should not be changed

// 3. Always use const if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

// 4. Only use let if you can't use const

// 5. Only use var if you MUST support old browsers.


// console.log("hello fro external ")

const a = 'janani';
let  age = 20;
